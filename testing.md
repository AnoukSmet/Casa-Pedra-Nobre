#### What did I test?
* Quality and display of hero image

#### Conclusion
Hero image looks nice across devices and browers. Image is of high quality.  
Carousel looks well across devices and browers.   
From small devices (from 320px onwards) until tablets, image is display above the text. Carousel resizes the height depending of the content of the slide.
Arrows to go left and right are displayed in the middle of the height of the carousel.   
On large devices, image is being displayed on the left, with the description and button on the right. 

### **Functionality**
Button 'Book now' within hero image works as planned and takes the user to the reservation page.
Buttons to move left and right in the carousel work as intented.   
Disabled automatic scrolling of the carousel to give the user the control to go to the next slide.   
Indicator below carousel to let the user know how many slides there are and where user is located on that moment. 
Link within the carousel work as planned and redirects the user to the corresponding page.

Due to the image being full view height, the user might not realize there is more information on this page.
To make this clear to the user, I have added a small arrow, pointing down, right below the book now button.
The user can also click on this button which will take him/her to the carousel down on the page.

### **Lighthouse report**
""" Include 2 image performance screenshots """  

In the beginning the performance was too low, around 60%. This was mainly caused by retrieving the images from AWS.
After some research, I have added metadata to my AWS Bucket to increase the max age for Cache Control. 
This immediately brought my perfomance up to 

### **User Experience**
#### User Story: I want the website to be visually appealing so I can already imagine myself being on holiday there
Drone image from the house with the slight overlay immediately creates a 'Wow' feeling while not overwhelming the user.
When you scroll down to the carousel, you immediately see a sneak peek from each page, give the user the feeling to 'wanting' to keep on exploring. 
This feeling I have recreated across each page in order to not lose the interest of the user. 


#### User Story: I want to have some information about the property and it's location
On the first slide of the carousel, the user can find some information about the property.  
It includes a couple of more known places closeby as well as some info about the house and when it was renovated.

Below the rooms the additional information text shows nicely and adjusts according the various devices and browers.
Images show nicely, are of high quality and show the user the complete experience in the bed & breakfast. 
The amenities, activities & experiences and policies are displayed in a nice list varying from 3 columns on large screens to 1 column on small screens. 

### Functionality
In order to make the page more visually appealing, I wanted the carousel for each room type to move at a different speed.
This I have done by setting the data-interval to different amount of seconds.

The buttons to take the user to the detail page of each room work well. Same counts for the buttons on the rooms detail page to take you back to the rooms page.
