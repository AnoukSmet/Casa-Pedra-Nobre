# **Casa Pedra Nobre**

``` Mock up Image ```

## **Goal for this project** 
Welcome to Casa Pedra Nobre, a bed & breakfast at the Silver Coast in Portugal.  
Have look at our website and discover what Casa Pedra Nobre and the Silver Coast has to offer.  
Book your favorite room, scroll down the MUST see, eat and do page and start planning your perfect stay in Portugal.   
We hope to welcome you on one of your Portugal trips in the near future.

This project was developed as my final project to complete the Full Stack Web Development course at Code Institute.   
I challenged myself for this last project by going out of the scope of the course because this project is close to my heart.   
This bed & breakfast belongs to my parents for which I did the start up in 2015.   
I managed the bed & breakfast for more than 2 years after which I passed it on to my parents to start my next adventure.  
You can find the original website here [Casa Pedra Nobre](www.casapedranobre.pt).

Thank you for visiting my project!  
If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.

### **Design Choices**

I have spent quite some time thinking about the design of the website for CPN. 
I will use the real logo og CPN and I will integrate the colors of the logo into the website.
The colors used bring a southern feeling to website which fits perfect with the location, Portugal. 

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to come up with the exact color scheme.  
You can find more information about the colors below. 

<a></a>

#### Colors

As CPN is THE place for guests to come and unwind, I wanted to user calming colors with a southern accent.


``` Color Palette ```

* #0C1E50
* #FCBC49
* #FFFFEB
* 853D1E

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>


#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the titles and subtitles, I will use the font [Baskervville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baskervville "Baskervville") 
and for the main text I have used [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla "Karla"). 

<a></a>

#### Structure

All my pages will start with a hero image, related to the content of the page with the navigation on top of the image.
My website will have the following pages:

* Landing / Home Page  
    The landing page is aimed to be visually attractive, with appealing images/icons that says "Welcome" by itself,  
    unconsciously engaging the user and creating curiosity to keep navigating throughout the website.
    On this page I want to display a sneak peek about every page, engaging the user to explore all Casa Pedra Nobre has to offer. 

* Rooms  
    Here the rooms will be displayed with some images and a short description of the rooms.
    Each room will also have a detail page, providing additional information to the user about the room. 
    Here the user will see all the image at a glance instead of in a carousel. There will also be a call to action to go to the reservations page.
    On the overview page of the rooms, below the rooms, there will be more information about the property. 
    This will include images from the breakfast, amenities, activities & experiences and policies. 

* Reservation page  
    This section will consists of multiple step spreaded over multiple pages.  
    Step 1: user selects preferred check-in and check-out data.  
    Step 2: available rooms and their prices will be displayed and the user select the amount of guests per room and add the room(s) they want.  
    Step 3: summary of the selected rooms and check-in/check-out data will be displayed, together with a form a finalise the reservation.  
    Step 4: Confirmation page will be displayed to the user.  

* Tourist Information  
    The page will consist out of 3 different sections:
    * Things to see: here I will display the villages and beaches in the surroundings of the bed & breakfast in card format,  
        the cards will be displayed in a carousel through which the user can navigate. 
    * Places to eat: the format / display will be the same but the cards will contain restaurants and bars.
    * Things to do: again the format / display will maintain the same but the content will change to activities and experiences.

* Gallery  
    The gallery page will be divided in 2 sections: property images and images of the surroundings.  
    Images will be displayed in a rather small format but with the possibility to click on the image to see it larger.
    There will be a counter and next/previous buttons to navigate through the gallery.

* Account page  
    Here the user will find an overview of their account details and their upcoming / past bookings.  
    Below that I will display a Favorites section that will be fed by the user adding places, restaurants to their favorites.
    The display of these favorites will be the same as on the tourist information page.

* Reservations page for admin
    For the owner of the breakfast or admin (superuser), there is a separate page with an overview of all the reservations. 
    The page is divided into 6 different sections: arrivals today / departures today / inhouse guests / arrivals next 7 days / all upcoming reservations / all past reservations
    With the help of the [Datatable CDN](https://cdn.datatables.net/), the reservations will be displayed in a nice table with the following functionailities:
    * Search functionality to search by name, date, room etc.
    * Pagination
    * Ability to show 10 / 25 / 50 / 100 reservations per page
    * Ability to sort on each of the columns
    * Link to the reservation confirmation page

## **Wireframes, Flowcharts and Database Structure**

### **Wireframes**
I used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website.   
For each page I created 3 wireframes: desktop, tablet and mobile.

[Landing / Home page](wireframes/home.png)  
[Reservation](wireframes/reservation.png)  
[Rooms](wireframes/rooms.png)  
[Tourist Information](wireframes/tourist_information.png)  
[Gallery](wireframes/gallery.png)  
[Profile](wireframes/profile.png)

### **Flowcharts**

I have decided to make a flowchart for the reservation process to completely understand each step.    
I have used [Draw.io](https://draw.io/) to make this flowchart which you can view below: 

![Flowchart](wireframes/flowchart_reservation_process.png)

### **Database Structure**

For the project I set up 9 database Models which you can see in the image below. 
I have highlighted the relationships between the various models with colors.

## **Features**

<a></a>

### **Existing Features**

* Registration and sign in functionality using the allauth package from Django
* Carousel on the homepage giving the user a sneak peek into what the other pages have to offer
* Social Media section on various page allowing the user to interact and stay up to date about the latest news and promotions.
* Reservation page that allows the user to book a stay for a certain period
* Add to favorites functionality which allows the user to add restaurants, places to visit etc to start planning their trip.
* Possibility for superuser / admin to make a reservation online without having to go through the payment. This so that owner can make reservations for users when they call for example.  
    In order for the owner to know whether the reservation was already paid or not (if owner makes it, no payment is done yet), I have added a column on the reservations page which checks for the stripe pid. 
    If there is no PID, the reservations shows as not paid yet. 

<a></a>

### **Features to be implemented**
* Dashboard for bed & breakfast owner with additional information:
    * Reservations divided by room booked and displayed nicely in a calendar
* Add walks in the surroundings of the bed & breakfast on the tourist information page which the user can download
* Implement additional functionality that calculates the price depending on the amount of guests, length of stay, season and so on.
* Implement promotions for multiple nights which would be advertisement on a separate page with a link to book that specific promotion

## Testing
Testing of this site can be found [here](https://github.com/AnoukSmet/casa-pedra-nobre/blob/master/testing.md) in a seperate file

## Bugs
Bugs of this site can be found [here](https://github.com/AnoukSmet/casa-pedra-nobre/blob/master/bugs.md) in a seperate file


## **Deployment**

### Local Deployment

I have created the project using Github, from there I used [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) to write my code. 
Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. 
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku master" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku. 

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps: 
I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod. 
You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

To clone the project: 

1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository.
    Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:

    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/AnoukSmet/Casa-Pedra-Nobre.git
    ``` 

1. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's [link to required modules](https://github.com/AnoukSmet/Casa-Pedra-Nobre/blob/master/requirements.txt) using the following command:

    ```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. 
    It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
    ```
    import os

    os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"

    os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
        
    ```

    If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.

1. Migrate the database models with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```
1. Create a superuser and set up the credentials with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
1. Run the app with the following command
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The address to access the website is displayed in the terminal  
    Add /admin to the end to access the admin panel with your superuser credentials

    
### To deploy your project on Heroku, use the following steps: 

1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region. 
1. Once the app is created click on the resources button and choose the Heroku Postgres to attach a postgres database to your project.
    ![Add Postgres Database](wireframes/heroku_postgres.png)

1. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py ():
    !You shouldn't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, only in your env.py to prevent DEBUG being active on live website. 

    ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
    DATABASE_URL = "This variable is automatically set when adding the Postgres Add on"
    EMAIL_HOST_PASS = "EMAIL_HOST_PASS"
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = "EMAIL_HOST_USER"
    SECRET_KEY = "SECRET_KEY"
    STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"
    STRIPE_WH_SECRET = "STRIPE_WH_SECRET"
    USE_AWS = True
    ```
1. From this screen, copy the value of DATABASE_URL
1. After this go to your settings.py and comment out the default database configuration and add:
    ```
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('< Put your DATABASE_URL here >'))
    }
    ```
1. Migrate again with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```


1. Load the data into your newly created database by using the following command: 

    ```
    python3 manage.py loaddata <name of file containing the data>
    ``` 

1. After migrations are complete, change database configurations to:
```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
            }
        }
```
This set up will allow your site to use Postgres in deployment and sqlite3 in development.

1. Create a superuser for the postgres database so you can have access to the django admin by setting up the credentials with the following command
    ```
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

1. Create a Procfile freeze your requirements by running the following commands: 
    Requirements:
    ```
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```
    Procfile:
    ```
    echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    ```
1. The Procfile should contain the following line:
    ```
    web: gunicorn <project_name>.wsgi:application

    ```

1. Add your files and commit them to GITHUB by running the following commands:
    ```
    git add . 
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    git push
    ```

1. Add your Heroku app URL to ALLOWED_HOSTS in your settings.py file
1. Go back to HEROKU and click "Deploy". Scroll down and click "Enable automatic deployment".
1. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
1. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes. 


1. Store your static files and media files on AWS. You can find more information about this on [Amazon S3 Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).
    If you would like to follow a tutorial instead, visit [this tutorial on Youtube from Amazon Web Services](https://youtube.com/watch?v=e6w9LwZJFIA)

1. Set up email service to send confirmation email and user verification email to the users. You can do this
