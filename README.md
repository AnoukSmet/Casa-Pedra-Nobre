# **Casa Pedra Nobre**

``` Mock up Image ```

## **Goal for this project** 
Welcome to Casa Pedra Nobre, a bed & breakfast at the Silver Coast in Portugal.  
Have look at our website and discover what Casa Pedra Nobre has to offer.
Book your favorite room, scroll down the MUST see, eat and do page and start planning your perfect stay in Portugal. 
We hope to welcome you on one of your Portugal trips in the near future.


This project was developed as my final project to complete the Full Stack Web Development course at Code Institute. 
I challenged myself for this last project by going out of the scope of the course.

Thank you for visiting my project!
If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.
